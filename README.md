## About this Course
This is an intermediate Java course recommended to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science.
The goal is that by the end of this course you feel empowered to create a Java program that’s more advanced than any you have created in the past and that is
personally interesting to you. In achieving this goal you will also learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, how to leverage the power of existing libraries,
how to build graphical user interfaces, and how to use some core algorithms for searching and sorting data.

### Week 1: Object design: constructors, instance variables, methods
Key Concepts
* Describe the role of this course and this specialization within the computing field.
* Explain how the various components of the class (project, core, etc.) connect.
* Choose the path through the course which works well for you.
* Determine if this is the right course for you.
* Explain why classes and objects are useful in programming
* Create objects and call methods on them
* Describe member variables, methods and constructors
* Explain how to overload methods in Java and why overloading methods is useful
* Describe the meaning of the keywords public and private and their effect on where variables can be accessed

### Week 2: Memory Models, Scope, and Starting the Project
Key Concepts
* Select and effectively use Java documentation
* Generate visual maps using Java code and the Unfolding Maps libraries
* Create and draw memory models for reasoning about variable values for primitive and object data types
* Apply the basic rules for variable scope and explain how it impacts your code
* Practice tracing code using memory models and Java's rules for variable scope

### Week 3: Graphical output: Creating GUIs and Displaying Data
Key Concepts
* Create and manipulate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
* Use Java documentation in an effective manner
* Use the Processing library in your programs
* Modify and customize visual maps using Java code
* Use Java to read and parse data files
* Categorize data into appropriate objects
* Describe and use the List data type and the ArrayList class
* Describe and use the Map data type

### Week 4: Inheritance
Key Concepts
* Explain the value of inheritance as a feature in object oriented programming languages
* Use the keyword extends
* Explain the relationship between a superclass and a subclass
* Use UML Diagrams to display class hierarchies
* Explain an “is-a” relationship between classes
* Describe how Java object construction occurs from the inside out
* Use same-class and superclass constructors in class creation
* Create methods which override from a superclass
* Compare and contrast method overloading and method overriding
* Explain the purpose of polymorphism
* Inspect and step through decisions made at compile time and runtime
* Use casting of objects to aid the compiler
* Use the keyword "abstract"
* Compare and contrast “inheritance of implementation” and “inheritance of interface”
* Choose between Abstract Classes and Interfaces

### Week 5: GUIs: Responding to User Events
Key Concepts
* Distinguish between Abstract Classes and Interfaces
* Analyze event-driven code
* Explain how mouse-clicks and keyboard input interact with the program execution
* Design user-interface elements
* Write code to implement a button and respond to mouse events
* Describe inheritance relationships used in the course so far
* Distinguish between interfaces and classes in this hierarchy

### Week 6: Searching and Sorting: From Code to Algorithms
Key Concepts
* Recognize the importance of search
* Write code to perform a linear search
* Explain and implement the binary search algorithm
* Explain why binary search is better than linear search
* Define sorting
* Explain why sorting data can be useful
* Explain and implement the selection sort algorithm
* Interpret the code and describe its high-level function
* Describe alternate algorithms for sorting
* Use pre-defined Java methods to sort
* Explain the properties of this built-in sort algorithm
* Define and use the Comparable interface in Java
